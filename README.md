# MyProfilePage
 App Development Assignment:

 In developing my personal profile page with React Native, I embraced a minimalist design, choosing a soothing pastel color scheme to create a relaxing environment. Centered content, especially the profile image and header, was a deliberate choice to keep the page balanced and visually cohesive. For ease of interaction, form elements were designed with user-friendliness in mind, featuring rounded corners and soft colors.

The project had its set of challenges, notably in image handling where I learned to convert HEIC to JPEG for compatibility. Separating the styles from the main code was a strategic decision for better manageability. Each obstacle encountered turned into a valuable lesson, contributing to a simple yet charming profile page that I'm proud to share.
